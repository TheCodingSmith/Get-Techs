    <h6>Equipment</h6>

    <span>Our pressure washing units are capable of 3,000 PSI and 210 degrees of hot water with a flow of 5.0 gallons of water per minute. Don't be fooled by our high pressure machines.

    <span>We have a large capacity water recovery system that collects waste water and filters it to be disposed of according to EPA regulations.</span>

    <span>We also use a wide variety of detergents, soaps and other chemicals, all of which are diluted carefully for each individual job in order to insure the best results.</span>

    <span>Our detergents are safe for plants and animals. When run off water is an issue we can reclaim and recycle the water by using a series of pumps and filters.</span>
